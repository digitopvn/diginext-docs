# Container Registries

At the moment, `dx` supports these container registries:

1. Docker Hub Registry (DHR)
2. Google Container Registry (GCR)
3. Digital Ocean Container Registry (DOR)

Donâ€™t see your container registry? Check out my [Roadmap](https://www.notion.so/Roadmap-6a8266c2929c48ad8d4c11c954e9d852?pvs=21) 

## Authenticate Docker Hub Registry

## Authenticate Google Container Registry

Similar with GKE authorization, to authenticate DXUP with GCR, you need a Google Cloud Service Account, if you already got one, you only need to access Google Cloud Console and assign GCR read & write permissions to it, then get back to your workspace and fulfill the form.

## Authenticate Digital Ocean Container Registry

DigitalOcean provides API access token to authenticate with their Container Registry
