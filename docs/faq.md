## Should I install Diginext Server on the same cluster with our apps?

**NOT RECOMMEND.** Building apps is the process that sometime requires a lot of machine‚Äôs resources, especially the complex ones, if this happens, it would cause interuption of the other apps/deployments.

## Can I use internal APIs/commands which is not documented on the site?

**NOT RECOMMEND.** Internal API/command is not guaranteed to be compatible with future versions. It might be unstable, buggy and break your deploy environments. It may be removed or changed in some versions. If you really need to use it, you should to make sure these APIs/commands are still valid when upgrading to a new version or just lock version for usage.

## Why API/commands request should be strict discussion?

We are cautious when adding APIs/commands because some APIs/commands may not be abstract enough to become historical debt. For example, when there is a need to change the way of interaction, these poor abstractions may cause breaking changes. To avoid such problems, we recommend that new features be implemented through higher order APIs/commands first.
