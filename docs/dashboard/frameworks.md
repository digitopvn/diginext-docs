# Frameworks

Developers usually don’t start a new project from scratch, instead we start from a boilerplate, a starter template, a library, or whatever you call it. In DXUP, I call it **“Framework”**.

This is a collection of starter templates so you and any members of your team can start a new project from, whether it’s your own repositories, or public repositories.

## Workspace framework library

This collection is only visible to your workspace members.

## Public framework library

On the other hand, this collection is from the community, where you can start your project from the amazing frameworks of all around the world.

In this page, you or your workspace member can also give back to the community by contributing your useful frameworks. 

Because, *giving is forever*.
