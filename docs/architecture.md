### Workspace

You can treat it as your **organization**. 

At the highest level, a workspace is a set of development tools and cloud resources, which your organization is managing. These resources can be Kubernetes clusters, git repositories, databases, storage buckets, or whatever else added into the DX ecosystem in the future.

## Login to your workspace

Examples: 

- `dx login http://localhost:6969`
- `dx login http://<workspace>.diginext.site` (replace `<workspace>` with yours, you can get this domain by create new workspace on my website - https://diginext.site)
