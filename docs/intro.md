# Introduction

![diginext banner](/img/dx-banner.png)

## Infrastructure is hard. Kubernetes is harder.

Pushing developers to learn it even harder (and cruel, their life is already really tough nowadays)

***Developers should not be frustrated by deploying apps to the infrastructure or bothering DevOps engineers for help. They should fully focus on developing apps and not need to understand servers, domains, or other infrastructure-related tasks.***

> *Focus on building apps, shipping fast, and shinning, and leave your cloud infrastructure to DXUP.*

:::info 
👉 `dx` also means **Developer Experience**, and this is our number one goal - create the best experience for developers.

### *“Make coding great again”*

Made for any programming languages, for projects big and small, developers should only bring their code, and **DXUP** handles the rest.
