The **DXUP Command Line Interface (CLI)** (`dx`) lets you interact with your DXUP workspace from the command line, allowing you to:

- Create new DXUP projects from the Terminal
- Link a local project directory to an existing DXUP project
- Monitor status & logs of remote applications
- Utilize AI technology to improve developer experience (DX) & productivity
- And more!

Below is the list of available commands:

---
