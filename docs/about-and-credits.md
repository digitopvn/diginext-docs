# About & credits

My name is **Duy** (pronounce: */Yu-ee/*), people usually call me Goon. I‚Äôm a CEO as well as a CTO of my own company - TOP GROUP (a.k.a DIGITOP) - in Viet Nam.

## My business

I started a business that ‚Äúhalf as an marketing agency and half as a tech company‚Äù on 2015, I got  40 sweet guys until now, I also have a great dev team in house with a strong knowledge about developing web-apps, AR/VR technology and platform systems.

## My background

Before opening my own business, (just like you) I‚Äôve been a developer, and also a designer, a project manager, a tech lead, a creative director and a CTO at some advertising agencies, such as VNG, Mirum, JWT,‚Ä¶ for years. I think I‚Äôm lucky to have the opportunities to work with many clients across different industries, that gave me a lot of good experience.

## My experience in DevOps

After more than 6 years of adopting Kubernetes for my clients, partners, and my own businesses, I have found that the most difficult aspect is training my development team on Kubernetes and how to deploy apps onto it.

Successfully managing Kubernetes clusters requires a deep understanding of so many concepts, definitions, and practices involved. With so much to consider, it can be difficult for developers to know how to deploy apps in the most effective way.

That‚Äôs why I built a simple deployment tool‚Ä¶ and then it has been envolved to **Diginext** now.

## My ambition

- As a developer with over 15 years of experience, I have mixed feelings about developers today. On the one hand, they are fortunate to have access to modern technologies, frameworks, and useful libraries to work with. On the other hand, I empathize with them because I know firsthand how daunting it can be to keep up with the continuous learning required in this field. Their career path will be a long journey filled with head-scratching and late nights (and dark eyes).
- So I want to help, I want to simplize things, complicated definitions, vague concepts,‚Ä¶ into something much more simple to understand, something closer to their daily life, and really straightforward.
- **Let‚Äôs make coding great again!**

## My wife

*(**‚ÄùWTF???‚Äù,** lol I know, let me tell you my story)*

Coding is my hobby. Even as I've progressed in my career, I just can't quit coding. (I tried, trust me, so many times). 

This has become a problem for my wife, as she questions my obsession with coding. I spent the whole day talking to the computer instead of helping with household tasks. (I did some tasks every day, but it just wasn't enough üòÖ¬†, please tell me that I‚Äôm not the only one)

One of her questions is: *‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just like the others? (just work for 8 hours/day) You spend time for coding even when you‚Äôre at home with no reasons, but there is **nothing changes**, then why?‚Äù*

I need the answer, and if my ambition becomes true, it could be the answer, I will show it to my wife and say ***‚ÄúSee, something changes!‚Äù*** haha.
