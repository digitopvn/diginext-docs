## Branch Organization

According to our [release schedule](notion://www.notion.so/changelog#release-schedule), we maintain two branches, `main` and `feature`. If you send a bugfix pull request, please do it against the `main` branch, if it's a feature pull request, please do it against the `feature` branch.

## Bugs

We are using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/digitopvn/diginext/issues) for bug tracking. The best way to get your bug fixed is by providing reproduction steps with this [template](https://github.com/digitopvn/diginext/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D).

Before you report a bug, please make sure you've searched existing issues, and read our [FAQ](https://www.notion.so/FAQ-10d5eed0f5bf44749c0997a29aebe6b6?pvs=21).

- If you intend to change the public API/command, I also recommend to use my [issue template](https://github.com/digitopvn/diginext/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=propose_change.md&title=) to create a proposal.
- If you are about to propose a new feature, double check our [Roadmap](https://www.notion.so/Roadmap-6a8266c2929c48ad8d4c11c954e9d852?pvs=21) to see if itâ€™s there or not, if not, you can use the [issue template](https://github.com/digitopvn/diginext/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=propose_change.md&title=) to create a proposal.
